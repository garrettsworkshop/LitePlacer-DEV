**Beta release, release candidate**

Previous release 08/23/2021, changes after that:

New Features, significant changes

* Video to UI is scaled down to UI resolution (much better performance), 
  measurements and visual processing use full resolution image for precision
* (in previous release) Added adjustable delay (in frames) to camera measurements
* Multiple rows can be deleted from tapes data table
* Cameras have properties button , and can now use fixed exposure (*setting stored in camera)
* Up camera assisted placement (*beta)
* Negative move guard sizes are now user settable
* vision processign setup has +-10 buttons on int parameter

Bug Fixes 

* Setting pixel size now works correctly regardless of zoom and show pixel setting
* Changing zoom and show pixels status now recalculates the box size
* Box size is not shown if it is not valid
* No crash if nozzle correction is asked when no nozzle is loaded
* Screen resolution settings did not always clear red error color
* You can now click the image to move the machine even if it is not homed
* Tape type drop box was not always filled with vision algorithm names
* job data value and footprint columns are narrower, so that nozzle number is visible
* deleting the first tape is now possible
* basic setup tab now shows pump and vacuum statuses correctly 
* Job file can be sorted by used nozzle, minimizing nozzle changes during run.
  [This has always been possible, but the feature is now more visible (in docs and tooltip text)]
* Setting machine size now sets movement limits on control board 
* UI made clearer in several places

Known issues

* If you change camera resolution, you need to re-set pixel size
* Pause and Stop need to be clicked twice
* The application does not automatically restart when loading new settings from file. (there is now a dialog, though)
* Place fast sometimes uses last hole (which might not be whole), not the second to last as excpected
